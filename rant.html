           <p>So recently I've gotten quite obsessed with the game Dangan Ronpa or Danganronpa, which ever is correct as
           I've seen the spacing change constantantly.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>The first time I had heard of the game was when I watched a MLP thing that had apparently taken a lot cues
            from the game. As that fandom continues to seem to do me, I was baffeled as realativly famous reviewers from
            their community were brutally murdered by some demon thing for having opionions differing from hers.The spectacle got
            me curious but not enough so to actually see the show. As a side note the deaths in that far exceed the gruesomeness
            in the actual show... because when ponies get involved the first you think of brutal brutal murder.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>

            <p>
            </p>
            <p>I first really caught intrest in it because of the abridged series. Which I found odd as that has never
            happened to me before. Neverbefore had I stopped watching an abridged series so not to spoil me of what happened
            in the show. Not for Sword Art Online, Full Metal Alchemist, Code Geass, Attack on Titan, not a one grabbed me like this.
            I'm not even really sure why either. Nothing in that first episode really sticks out in my head as to why I
            Had been so interested in it. Maybe it was just because it was a mystery and I wanted to figure it out myself.

           <p>
            </p>
            <p>Regardless of why, I decided to watch the anime adaption of the game as I had no real way to play the game.
            What I watched I really really enjoyed. It had managed to keep my interest all the way through and actually surpise 
            me sometimes. The characters felt strong, for the most part, and their is not a single thing that I felt was 
            out of no where, which honestly is pretty rare for mystery based, well anythings. The shows I've watched recently
            have had a lot trouble with staying good all the way through (R.I.P Samurai Flamenco) so this was a very nice 
            change of pace.

             <p>I think that's enough for now more about this later... maybe... if I feel like... Tata.
